# Tasktracker3

Design Decisions:
 * All the users can assign tasks to any other user.
 * The users can edit their or other users tasks.
 * A list of all the tasks in the system is visible to all users.
 * The users can edit or delete any of the tasks.
 * The user can select tasks as pending or completed.
 * The user must create a password while registering for the first time.
 * The user can login using his email-id and password.
 * There is only one page in the application.
 * All the pages are rendered using react-router and react-redux.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
